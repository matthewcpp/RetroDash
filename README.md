### Building for Nintendo 64

You will need to have nodejs and docker installed.

1. Ensure you have built the `mksprite` tool from the [libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon) repo.  It is loacted in the `tools/mksprite` directory.
1. From the root of the repo run `npm install` to install the [libdragon docker container](https://github.com/anacierdem/libdragon-docker).
1. Run `npx libdragon start` to start the docker container.
1. Run `node tools/prepare_n64_assets.js /path/to/libdragon/tools/mksprite/mksprite` to prepare the game assets.
1. Run `npx libdragon make -f Makefile.n64 clean` to clear previous build artifacts.
1. Run `npx libdragon make -f Makefile.n64` to build the ROM file.


### Testing with cen64

cen64 can easily be built from source on linux and MacOS with [cmake](https://cmake.org/). 
On macOS you will need to install and run the emulator using the xquartz terminal.  You can run `brew cask install xquartz` to easily install it.

1. Clone [cen64](https://github.com/n64dev/cen64) from github.
1. Create a build directory: `cd cen64 && mkdir build && cd build`
1. Build the emulator: `cmake .. && make`

In order to run the emulator you will need to get access to a `pifdata.bin` BIOS file.
Test the game by invoking the emulator from a terminal window: 
```shell script
	./cen64 -multithread /path/to/pifdata.bin /path/to/RetroDash.z64
```

### Building for Desktop

You will need to have cmake, nodejs, and sdl installed.

MacOS: `brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer`  
Ubuntu Linux: `sudo apt-get -y install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev`  
Windows: `cd build && conan install .. --build=sdl2_mixer`

```shell script
node tools/prepare_sdl_assets.js
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

### Building for Xbox:

Clone the [nxdk](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk) repo from github and follow the instructions for configuring the SDK.
Note that on Ubuntu 20.04 you may need to append to your path directory for the `llvm-lib` command to work during the build process:
```
PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/llvm-10/bin
```
Prepare Assets and Generate your xbe
```shell script
node tools/prepare_sdl_assets.js
make -f Makefile.xbox NXDK_DIR=/path/to/nxdk
```

### Building with Emscripten
Build the HTML / JS / WebAssembly using the [emsdk docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/emscripten/emsdk): 
```shell script
node tools/prepare_emscripten_assets.js
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -u $(id -u):$(id -g) emscripten/emsdk /bin/bash -c "cd build-emscripten; emcmake cmake ..; make"
```
Start web server: `npx http-server`
